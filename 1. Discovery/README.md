# Discovery
## Summary
Regardless of your cloud strategy (greenfield, lift and shift, hybrid, etc) it is important to understand where you are coming from in order to get where you are going.  For this purpose, the first step in the cloud journey is a discovery session.  The discovery session is not about what you want to do in the cloud, but rather where you are coming from today.  The discovery questionaire in the artifacts folder goes through a series of questions around people, process and technology to serve as a common foundation on which all participants can work.  As new team members are brought onto a cloud project, be they internal employees, new hires, consultants, or contractors  they can be provided with the completed discovery questionnaire as a starting point to get a baseline on the current state.  This is not meant to be a requirements discussion or project charter its purpose is to establish a baseline.

This repository includes an example of a discovery artifact that the authors have used for other organizations successfully in the past.

## Key Points
* Discovery process is not meant to replace any type of formal project requirements traceability exercises
## Best Practices
* The process should document the current state of the environment.
* The process should create an inventory of products and tools in use today along with what they are used for and the current owership.
* The process should identify the requirements that are being satisfied by utilizing the tools.
* The process should document gaps not being met today.
* The process should include the collection of relevant diagrams and architecture (network flows) where possible that represent current state.
* The process should include at minimum representatives from networking, security, operations, systems, enterprise architecture and cloud teams. 
* The process should be done in collaboration with a person of expertise in the Azure cloud, such as a partner or your Microsoft account team.
