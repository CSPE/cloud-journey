# Discovery
## Summary
Documenting the current state of your people, process, and technology is the first step in the journey to the cloud. This ensures all teams involved in the journey are working from the same set of facts, can identify potential blockers, and aids in prioritization of people and resources.  

This module includes a questionnaire which captures critical data points around people, process and technology. It was developed by the authors based upon years of experience assisting organizations with moving into the cloud. It is not intended to replace a formal requirements gathering effort, but rather to give organizations a place to start. The completed questionnaire can be helpful to save time during discovery with professional services or to provide an artifact to help onboard new team members joining the cloud program.

## Key Points
* The discovery module is not meant to replace formal project requirements traceability exercises.
* The discovery module is an important tool to ensure teams involved with a cloud program are working from the same set of information.

## Best Practices
* The process should document the current state of the environment which includes people and process in addition to technology.
* The process should create an inventory of products and tools in use today by the organization and those responsible them.
* The process should identify the requirements that are being satisfied by the products and tools.
* The process should current document gaps in people, process, and technology.
* The process should include relevant architectural diagrams. This includes detail around network flows.
* The process should include at minimum representatives from networking, security, operations, systems, enterprise architecture and cloud teams.
* The process should be done in collaboration with a person of expertise in the Azure cloud, such as a partner or your Microsoft account team.
